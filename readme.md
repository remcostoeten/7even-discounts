7even Discounts is a web scraper project that aims to help users find products on Amazon with discounts up to 99%. The project uses websockets to constantly scrape Amazon's website for the latest discounts, and provides real-time updates to users.

Currently, the project has a landing page where users can see the latest discounted products, but the plan is to add additional features such as authentication and support for multiple other shops in the future.
